Used Boosting Algorithms (XGB) to find the missing values, implemented all pre-processing steps to find the corelation between the values, removing outliers, applied transformations to reduce Skewness in data, applied Grid search to find the best hyperparameter, cross validation, used different performance metrics to evaluate the perfomance of the model
